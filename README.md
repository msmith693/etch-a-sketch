# etch-a-sketch
An interactive etch-a-sketch!

This is the penultimate project on The Odin Project's Foundations course. My goal for this project was to better understand eventListeners and DOM management.

## Challenges

#### Hover logic
While I could have maybe used the :hover CSS pseudoclass to achieve the colour change on hover, this was not the point of the exercise. I had some issues with modifying the style of divs using eventListeners.

#### Assigning eventListeners
This was a problem earlier on in the process, as I could not figure out how to assign eventListeners to all the divs that were created without doing it manually. This is a pretty common process with eventListeners however, and was solved by styling the divs initially and then adding eventListeners within a loop. The problem arose through a lack of understanding about eventListeners.
